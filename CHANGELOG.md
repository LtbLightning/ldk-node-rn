## [0.1.0]

This is the first release of `ldk_node`. It features support for sourcing chain data via an `Esplora` server, filesystem persistence, gossip sourcing via the `Lightning` peer-to-peer network, and configurble entropy sources for the integrated LDK & BDK-based wallets.

- `setEntropySeedBytes` - Configures the `Node` instance to source its wallet entropy from the given seed bytes.

- `setEntropyBip39Mnemonic` - Configures the `Node` instance to source its wallet entropy from a BIP 39 mnemonic.

- `setEsploraServerUrl` - Sets the `Esplora` server URL. Default: https://blockstream.info/api

- `setGossipSourceP2p` - Configures the `Node` instance to source its gossip data from the Lightning peer-to-peer network.

- `setGossipSourceRgs` - Configures the `Node` instance to source its gossip data from the given RapidGossipSync server.

- `setStorageDirPath` - Sets the used storage directory path.

- `setNetwork` - Sets the `Bitcoin` network used.

- `setListeningAddress` - Sets the IP address and TCP port on which Node will listen for incoming network connections. Default: 0.0.0.0:9735

- `build` - Builds an `Node` instance according to the options previously configured.

`Node Methods:`

- `start` - Starts the necessary background tasks, such as handling events coming from user input, `LDK/BDK`, and the peer-to-peer network.

- `stop` - Disconnects all peers, stops all running background tasks, and shuts down Node.

- `syncWallets` - Sync the `LDK & BDK` wallets with the current chain state.
